Instructions for Cake v0.1 Beta CS Background Changer.

I take no responsibility for this program what so ever. It works for me, it may not for you.


1. Getting it to Run
2. How to work it
3. Thats it

IMPORTANT: You MUST manually create the following directories if you aint already done so.
in c:\program Files\Steam\SteamApp\<Your-e-mail address>\Counter-Strike\cstrike
Create a dir called "resource" inside your cstrike dir
go inside the resource dir and create another dir called "background"
This is where you will save or copy your image to.



1. 	OK, I'm no master programmer so the program is a bit rubbish, but it
	does work. Firstly extract the files from the RAR archive to a directory
	of your choice, eg. c:\cake
	Next you need to register the DLL's or it wont run. To do this, open a
	DOS/Command Prompt. Change to the dir where you extracted the archive.
	e.g. cd c:\cake
	Next, register the Dll with the command "regsvr32 imagXpr6.dll" .
	That should be it, it should now run by double clicking cake.exe from
	Windows Explorer.

2.	When it loads up. Click Load Image, this should popup a window with dir
	and file listings. Change to the directory with your pictures you want
	to use. when you get there, it should be listing all the supported 
	graphics type files in the bottom box. Clicking once on a file name
	should give you a preview of the image and its details like width and
	length etc. Note that you can use any size of image as the program will
	resize it automatically to the required 800x600 resolution, however,
	if the picture you choose to use is not close to the correct dimensions
	it will look well rubbish when it's re-sized. Once you've selected a 
	picture to use, click the open button. You should now see your picture
	displayed at 800x600 format on the main window. Now all you do is choose
	where to save the broken down picture. Click "Save to directory.." button
	This will open up a new window where you can choose where to save the 
	files. Note that it will write 12 files with the names:- 
		800_1_a_loading.tga
		800_1_b_loading.tga
		800_1_c_loading.tga
		800_1_d_loading.tga
		800_2_a_loading.tga
		800_2_b_loading.tga
		800_2_c_loading.tga
		800_2_d_loading.tga
		800_3_a_loading.tga
		800_3_b_loading.tga
		800_3_c_loading.tga
		800_3_d_loading.tga

	You can either write the files to somewhere like c:\cake, and manually move 
	them or you can	write them directly to the CS subdir 
	c:\Program Files\steam\Steamapp\<your-e-mail>\Counter-Strike\cstrike\resource\background
	Obviously the your e-mail bit will be different for everyone though. 
	Also note that it WILL overwrite your existing image if any.
	Thats pretty much it, load up CS and see if it works.  If CS crashes, then somethings 
	obviously wrong. Just delete the image files and CS should work again.

3.	Thats it. The programs no master piece and didnt take long to write, it works for me,
	if it doesnt work for you, then I'm sorry.  You can e-mail me at tizer001@beer.com and
	I'll try and get time to reply.
